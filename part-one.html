      was created by renowned English graphic designer, typographer, and art
      director, and founder of Brody Associates. Neville Brodyâ€™s design history
      has evolved from creating record covers and rethinking magazine design and
      art direction to working with globally renowned companies like Christian
      Dior, Nike, and the BBC. Largely focused on typography, Brody has been at
      the forefront of many developments in type culture, from his hand-drawn
      headlines for The Face magazine and experimental typographic platform
      FUSE, to global fonts for Coca-Cola, Samsung, and Channel4.
